### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**dd1929/dd1929** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ğŸ˜ƒ I am dd1929!
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [apod-viewer](https://www.github.com/dd1929/apod-viewer).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android development with Java.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing. Or maybe something.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: at my home, of course. But not now.
